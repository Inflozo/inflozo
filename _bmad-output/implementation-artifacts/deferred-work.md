# Deferred work

Findings that are real, are not this story's to fix, and would otherwise be lost. The story board
reads this file. An entry is closed by the story that fixes it, never by deleting the row.

Besides the fields the format defines, every entry carries **`plain:` — one sentence a non-engineer
reads**, because the owner sees this ledger on the story board and `reason:` is written for a
developer. Write it in the owner's language: what is not right, and what it costs him. The board
falls back to `reason:` when an entry has no `plain:`, which reads as jargon and is the bug, not the
fallback.

### DW-1: `packages/library` declares no entry point, so the dependency arrow cannot resolve

plain: The shared parts store has no way in yet, so no other part of the code can take anything out of it; the first story that needs to will build the door.
status: open
severity: medium
origin: Story 1.1 review (2026-09-04)
location: packages/library/package.json
reason: The three core packages each declare `"@inflozo/library": "workspace:*"`, but `library` has
  no `exports` and no `main`, so `import '@inflozo/library'` cannot resolve today. Nothing imports it
  yet, so the shape of the entry point is a guess until a consumer exists — AD-2 says data only, no
  executable module, so it is likely a data-file `exports` map rather than a module. The first story
  that reads the library (1.3) decides the shape and proves it with an import that crosses the
  boundary; today's three tests each assert only their own package name and cross nothing.

### DW-2: `apps/web` declares no dependency on the core packages, so `transpilePackages` is inert

plain: The website has not been told it is allowed to use the four building blocks, so a setting that connects them currently does nothing.
status: open
severity: low
origin: Story 1.1 review (2026-09-04)
location: apps/web/package.json · apps/web/next.config.ts
reason: `next.config.ts` lists the three core packages in `transpilePackages`, but `apps/web` does
  not depend on them and `node_modules/@inflozo` does not exist. The entries are no-ops until the
  first `import '@inflozo/section-runtime'`, which will fail to resolve until the `workspace:*`
  dependencies are added. Adding them now would be speculative; the story that imports adds its own.

### DW-3: `@types/node` is two majors ahead of the pinned runtime

plain: The reference notes describing our engine are two versions ahead of the engine we actually run, so code could be written against something that is not there.
status: open
severity: low
origin: Story 1.1 review (2026-09-04)
location: apps/web/package.json · packages/{section-runtime,ghost-shim,theme-compiler}/package.json
reason: `@types/node@26.4.1` types Node 26 while the stack pins Node 24.x, so code can typecheck
  against an API the deployed runtime does not have. The blast radius is small today — AD-1 forbids
  the core packages from calling Node at all, so the types serve only `node:test` in test files —
  and correcting it changes the lockfile, which wants its own install-and-verify pass.

### DW-4: `.toString()` is banned on every receiver, not only on a Date

plain: One safety rule is stricter than intended and also blocks a few harmless things; nothing is broken, and it gets narrowed the first time it blocks real work.
status: open
severity: low
origin: Story 1.1 review (2026-09-04)
location: eslint.config.js
reason: AD-1 bans `.toString()` *on a Date*; the selector cannot see the receiver's type, so it also
  fires on `Number#toString`, `Buffer#toString` and `Error#toString`. It errs toward safety, which is
  the right side to err on, but the first time it blocks ordinary code someone will reach for a
  disable comment — and `/* eslint-disable no-restricted-syntax */` silences the locale and clock
  bans sitting beside it. Worth narrowing when a core package first has real code to narrow against.

### DW-5: the GitHub token expires 2027-09-05 and nothing carries the date

plain: The GitHub key that lets me read whether the safety check passed stops working on 5 September 2027, and nothing yet reminds anyone.
status: open
severity: low
origin: Story 1.1 review (2026-09-04)
location: tools/probe/.env.example
reason: The date lives in a comment and in this story's Verification. When it lapses, every later
  story's "CI is green" read starts returning 401 with no forewarning. This project's convention for
  a dated external deadline is a register row with a trigger, as the Supabase grants and gscan dates
  have; it needs one.

### DW-6: `node --test` warns MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON on every `apps/web` run

plain: Running the tests prints four harmless warning lines every time; nothing fails, it is only noise.
status: open
severity: low
origin: Story 1.1 review (2026-09-04)
location: apps/web/package.json
reason: `apps/web` sets no `"type"`, so Node reparses `routing.test.ts` as ESM and prints four lines
  of warning in every local and CI run. `"type": "module"` silences it, but whether Next 16 builds
  clean under it is a claim about an external platform and wants executing, not asserting — and this
  story's build is already green without touching it.
